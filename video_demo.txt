(0:00 - 0:15) [Introduction]

"Hi everyone, I am Aravind! Today, I’m showing you the latest intelligence upgrade to the 'Agentic Data Sanitizer.' 

We’ve now made the agent 'Instruction-Aware.' This means it is smart enough to decide when to give you a full 360-degree audit and when to focus with surgical precision on a specific question you ask."

(0:15 - 0:45) [Scenario 1: The Universal Analyst (Blank Input)]

"Let's look at Scenario A. I've uploaded my messy sales data. 

(Action: Point to the empty Custom instructions box)

If I leave the instruction box completely blank and click 'Execute,' the agent enters **Universal Mode**. It automatically generates a comprehensive suite of visualizations—Temporal trends, Financial outliers, and Category distributions—all at once. This is perfect when you just want to see everything 'wrong' with your data in one click."

---

(0:45 - 1:30) [Scenario 2: The Adaptive Analyst (Specific Input)]

"But what if I only care about one thing? Let’s say I want to see a histogram of my sales. 

(Action: Type 'Plot the distribution of Sales (histogram and KDE)')

In this update, when I provide a specific instruction, the agent becomes **Adaptive**. It still performs the full Agentic Pipeline in the background—auditing and cleaning the data—but it won't clutter your screen with 5 different charts. It focuses exclusively on exactly what I asked for: the Sales distribution."

(1:30 - 2:15) [Inside the Pipeline: Audit & Clean]

"Even in this focused mode, look at the 'Data Audit' tab. The agent still identified the missing values and the currency symbols. It cleaned the data first, and THEN plotted the histogram. 

This ensures that the specific chart you asked for is 100% accurate and free from the 'digital bacteria' of the raw CSV."

---

(2:15 - 2:45) [The Results: Visual Precision]

"Now, look at 'Intelligent Visuals.' Instead of a list of 5 charts, we have exactly what we needed: a high-precision histogram and KDE plot, with the outliers clearly managed. 

The AI decides what should be there based on your intent. If you're general, it's comprehensive. If you're specific, it's surgical."

---

(2:45 - 3:00) [Conclusion]

"The Agentic Data Sanitizer is now smarter and more respectful of your time. It gives you the full audit by default, but visualizes only what matters for your current task. 

It’s open-source, and all I ask is that you credit the work of Aravind S Gudi. Thanks for watching!"
