(0:00 - 0:15) [Introduction]

"Hi everyone, I am Aravind! Today, I’m excited to show you the latest evolution of my data agent: the 'Agentic Data Sanitizer.' 

If you've followed my work, you know I love building data tools. But this project is special. It’s not just a visualizer; it’s a digital hazmat suit for your analytics. We’re moving beyond 'pretty pictures' to 'trustworthy insights' by using a strict Agentic Pipeline."

(0:15 - 0:45) [The Problem: Dirty Data]

"We all know the 'Garbage In, Garbage Out' nightmare. Real-world data is filthy. It has currency symbols in numeric columns, inconsistent date formats, and spelling errors that split your categories into five different bars. 

A standard AI agent might just try to plot this mess and give you a broken chart. But the 'Sanitizer' is different. It acts like a Senior Data Scientist, scrubbing the data before it ever touches a canvas."

(0:45 - 1:30) [The Demo Walkthrough - Uploading & Visual Representation]

"Let’s upload this 'uncleaned_sales_data.csv.' 

(Action: Point to the upload button and then the Raw Data Preview)

The moment I upload, I can open the 'Raw Data Preview.' Look at this—I'm showing the full dataset here so you can see the mess. We have 'Electr0nics' with a zero, mixed dates like '02-Jan' and '01.04', and even a million-dollar laptop sale which is clearly an outlier. 

Visualizing this as-is would be a disaster. But notice what happened next to the input area..."

(1:30 - 2:00) [The AI Recommendation System]

"Here is the 'Context-Aware Recommendation Engine.' The agent has actually scanned my column names and predicted exactly what I need. 

Because it saw dates, it generated this blue 'Time Analysis' chip. Because it saw price and sales, it gave me this peach 'Revenue Deep-Dive.' These aren't just buttons—they are powerful, structured prompts that trigger the full Agentic Pipeline. I'll click 'Revenue Deep-Dive' now."

(2:00 - 2:45) [The Results: Audit, Clean, & Visualize]

"The pipeline is now executing: Validation, Preprocessing, and Anomaly Detection.

In the 'Data Audit' tab, we see our Health Score and a list of every formatting sin found. 

In the 'Execution Log,' we see the digital scrub brush at work: stripping symbols, standardizing dates, and isolating that million-dollar outlier so it doesn't skew our scale.

And finally, in 'Intelligent Visuals,' we get the truth. A perfectly calculated trend that merges all electronics sales into one and shows the real trajectory of the business. This is data you can actually base a decision on."

(2:45 - 3:00) [Conclusion]

"The Agentic Data Sanitizer makes analysis safer, faster, and more professional. It’s open-source, and all I ask is that if you use it or the pipeline architecture, please mention my name, Aravind S Gudi.

Thanks for watching, and let’s keep our data clean!"
