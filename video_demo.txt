(0:00 - 0:15) [Introduction]

"Hi everyone, I am Aravind! Today, I’m thrilled to show you the ultimate version of the 'Agentic Data Sanitizer.' 

This isn't just a data tool—it’s a Senior AI Data Scientist in a box. We’ve redesigned it from the ground up to be a 'Universal Analyst,' meaning it now automatically builds a full business report from messy data with a single click."

(0:15 - 0:45) [The Transparency: Full Data Preview]

"Let's start with the mess. I'm uploading this 'uncleaned_sales_data.csv.' 

(Action: Point to the upload button and then the Raw Data Preview)

We can now use the **Full Raw Data Preview** to see every single error. Look at these dates—they are in three different formats. Look at the sales—they have dollar signs and commas. And look at that million-dollar laptop sale on line 11—that's a huge anomaly. This is a digital dumpster fire, and usually, it would break any chart."

(0:45 - 1:15) [The Recommendation Super-Prompts]

"But notice these colorful chips. The system has already analyzed my data schema. It knows I have dates, revenue, and categories. 

These chips are now 'Super-Prompts.' When I click one, it focuses the AI's brain on that specific area while still ensuring the entire dataset is scrubbed and validated for safety."

(1:15 - 2:00) [The "Universal Analyst" Mode]

"Now, here is the real magic. I’m going to leave the instruction box completely empty. 

(Action: Point to the empty text area and click the blue button)

By clicking **Execute Agentic Pipeline** with no prompt, I trigger the **Universal Analyst Mode**. The agent automatically decides to perform a 360-degree audit across all dimensions—Time, Money, and Categories—simultaneously. It spins up a secure E2B sandbox and starts scrubbing."

---

(2:00 - 2:45) [The Results: Automated Intelligence]

"Look at the results! 

In the **Data Audit** tab, we now have a **Data Health Score**. It objectively rated our data's reliability. In the Cleaning Log, you can see it converted all those messy dates and stripped the currency symbols.

And in the **Intelligent Visuals** tab... this is incredible. The agent didn't just give me one chart. It automatically generated a **Temporal Trend**, a **Financial Anomaly Heatmap**, and a **Categorical Performance distribution**. All of this, from one 'Universal' click."

---

(2:45 - 3:00) [Conclusion]

"The Agentic Data Sanitizer makes professional-grade data engineering accessible to everyone. It's open-source, it's secure, and it's ready for your messiest CSVs.

Thanks for watching, and as always, let's keep our data clean!"
