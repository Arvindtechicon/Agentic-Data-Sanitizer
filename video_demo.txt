(0:00 - 0:15) [Introduction]

"Hi everyone, I am Aravind! Today, I’m excited to show you something I’ve been working on. 

This is the 'Agentic Data Sanitizer.' You might remember my previous project, the 'Data Visualization Agent.' Well, think of this as a huge upgrade. It’s not just about creating charts anymore—it’s about making sure the data behind those charts is actually clean and trustworthy."

(0:15 - 0:45) [The Problem & The Upgrade]

"We all know the saying: 'Garbage in, Garbage out.' If your data is messy—like having extra dollar signs, missing values, or weird typos—your charts will be wrong. 

That’s why I built the 'Agentic Pipeline.' Instead of just jumping to the visuals, this agent acts like a Senior Data Scientist. It automatically audits, cleans, and checks for anomalies before it ever draws a single line."

(0:45 - 1:30) [The Demo Walkthrough - Uploading]

"Let’s see it in action. I’m going to upload a very messy dataset here called 'uncleaned_sales_data.csv.'

(Action: Point to the upload button)

Once it's uploaded, you can see the raw data is a bit of a disaster. We have currency symbols mixed with numbers, missing dates, and even some crazy outliers—like a laptop being sold for a million dollars!

Now, instead of me doing the work, I’ll just use one of the 'AI Recommendations' tailored to my data or type a simple prompt like: 'Analyze my sales trends and handle any anomalies.'"

(1:30 - 2:15) [Explaining the Results]

"Look at what happens! The agent starts the Agentic Pipeline. 

First, look at the 'Data Audit' tab. It gives us a 'Data Health Score.' It found the missing values and the duplicate categories for us.

Next, in the 'Execution Log,' you can see exactly what it cleaned. It stripped the dollar signs, fixed the dates, and even flagged that million-dollar laptop as a technical error or an anomaly. This is huge because it means our final chart won't be ruined by that one mistake.

And finally, if we go to the 'Intelligent Visuals' tab... there it is! A beautiful, clean trend line. This chart is based on the 'sanitized' data, not the messy original."

(2:15 - 2:30) [Conclusion]

"This makes data analysis so much safer and faster. It’s completely open-source, and I’d love for you to check it out on my GitHub, play with the code, or even contribute. 

If you do use it, all I ask is that you mention my name, Aravind S Gudi, or the project process.

Thanks for watching, and let’s keep our data clean!"
